## OCELER

OCELER is a software platform for researchers to conduct experiments involving real-time subject collaboration through exogenously-determined communication network structures. [Gabe Mansur](https://github.com/gabemansur) developed this code, in collaboration with Jesse Shore, Ethan Bernstein, and Alice Jayoung Jang, and members of the Harvard Business School Research Computing Services team. We are grateful to the Harvard Business School Division of Research and Faculty Development for funding the creation of this tool.

### OCELER was built using:

- [Laravel](http://laravel.com) - PHP framework for the backend.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) - CSS styling.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.con) - AJAX and dynamic content.
