## OCELER

OCELER is a software platform for experiments involving real-time
subject collaboration. Gabe Mansur developed this code, in collaboration

Harvard Business School research computing team.

### OCELER was built using:

- [Laravel](http://laravel.com) - PHP framework for the backend.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) - CSS styling.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.con) - AJAX and dynamic content.
